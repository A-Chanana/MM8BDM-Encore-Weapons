=== v2a ===
== Doppel Crash ==
The general problem with this weapon on release was not being able to do much
in the way of killing people. Ran out of ammo quickly, and three hits on a
melee weapon is absurd, even for being a pseudo-Break Dash. This should
alleviate that by making it properly pace-fitting to kill with.
- Added explosion to hitbox.
- Reduced endlag on impact.
- Damage 47 > 52.

== Doppler Attack ==
This weapon following its concept was inherently weak from the beginning, with
hitting targets dead ahead being unlikely, for not much of any reward. These 
changes should give it the edge it needs to be a situationally powerful weapon.
- Damage 12/16 > 14/18. (Stationary/Launched)
- Rate of fire increased.
- Launched Speed 17.5 > 25.
- Upon launch, Doppler Attack will homing dash into any nearby enemies.
- Small explosion damage on death.
- Fixed NoAmmo and Death bugs.

== Wind Cyclone ==
Functionally this weapon had everything it needs, but the stats were not enough
to compare to the other weapons. Removing a limiter and increasing the stats
should suffice.
- No longer hits once.
- Damage lowered from 20 > 5 to compensate.
- Projectile wave speed increased.
- Projectile spread tightened.
